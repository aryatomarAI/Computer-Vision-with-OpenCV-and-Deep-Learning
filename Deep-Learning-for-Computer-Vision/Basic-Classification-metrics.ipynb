    "    \n",
    "    1. Either you modell was correct in its prediction \n",

    "    2. Or your model is incorrect in its prediction.\n",

    "    \n",
    "**1. Accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy in classification is the number of correct predictions made by the model divided by the total number of predictions.\n",

    "**2. Recall**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The precise definition of recall is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.\n",

    "**3. Precision**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.\n",
    "\n",

    "**4. F1-score**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In cases where we want to find an optimal blend of precisio and recall we can combine the two metrics using what is called the F1 score.\n",
